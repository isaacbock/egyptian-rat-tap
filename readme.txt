How to run a multiplayer game:

Our app supports multiplayer gaming. To test it, you will need two simulators or devices. They can both be on your computer or you can test the app with somebody else on two different computers. In the simulator or your device, go to Settings > Game Center. Sign in with an Apple ID. If you are testing with two simulators on your computer, you will need two different Apple ID sign-ins (you can just make a dummy test ID if necessary). After signing in to Game Center, open the app. When you click "Multiplayer", you should now be authenticated. Click "Ready!" to display the matchmaking popup, and click "Play Now" to match with other online players. If you are running on two simulators, you'll have to "Stop running" the app on one simulator to run it on the other, but you can just open the app back up in the first simulator and it will function correctly. The two simulators should match and then you can begin playing the game! If one player exits out, the other player will be notified and the game will quit.
